      <h2>How we use cookies</h2>
      <p>
        A cookie is a file containing an identifier (a string of letters and
        numbers) that is sent by a web server to a web browser and is stored by
        the browser. The identifier is then sent back to the server each time
        the browser requests a page from the server. Cookies may be either
        &ldquo;persistent&rdquo; cookies or &ldquo;session&rdquo; cookies: a
        persistent cookie will be stored by a web browser and will remain valid
        until its set expiry date, unless deleted by the user before the expiry
        date; a session cookie, on the other hand, will expire at the end of the
        user session, when the web browser is closed. Cookies do not typically
        contain any information that personally identifies a user, but personal
        information that we store about you may be linked to the information
